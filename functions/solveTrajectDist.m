% d = solveTrajectDist(G, T, boundaryIds, boundaryVal, tol, maxit)
%
% Inputs:
%
%   G: gradient operator matrix computed with grad() of gptoolbox [3*numCells x numPoints]
%   T: normalized tangent field defining the course of trajectories [numCells x 3]
%   boundaryIds: point IDs for Dirichlet boundary conditions [numBoundaryPoints x 1]
%   boundaryVal: values for Dirichlet boundary conditions [numBoundaryPoints x 1]
%   tol: tolerance for minres
%   maxit: maximum number of iterations for minres
%
% Outputs:
%
%   d: distance along trajectories (starting from boundaryIds with boundaryVal) [numPoints x 1]
